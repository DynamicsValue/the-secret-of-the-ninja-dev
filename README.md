# The Secret of the Ninja Dev

This repository contains the most hidden secret of ninja developers alike of all time : a secret hidden for centuries that will make your GitHub contribution activity explode!



# Building

Come on! Ninja developers who reach Chuck Norris level don't build software, they stare at the computer screen until they get the program they want, shipped globally with geo redundancy and a 100% SLA. 

For entry level ones, you might just run this script, which needs .net core 3.1 and powershell core.

    .\make-me-a-ninja-dev-now.ps1


# Contributing

This repo accepts contributions as long as they are of ninja-level quality. However, this is not a problem since you can run our secret script and become a ninja in no time!

# Sponsoring

Ninja devs don't need sponsors, they can turn coffee into code and they can pay coffee with GitHub stars... right?  RIGHT??


# Footnotes

This repo is obviously satire. 

Measuring contributions in number of commits would be the same as measuring the value of a piece of software in lines of code: plain stupid.  

We did conduct a study to measure the actual value that our OSS framework, [FakeXrmEasy](https://github.com/DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy), brings to companies, [you'll find the study here](https://dynamicsvalue.github.io/fake-xrm-easy-docs/why/study-summary/).

Also, when a company looks for ninja developers usually is a red flag where they want individuals to get the job of an entire department done while paying them an entry-level, junior salary. Stay away of these, for your own health & safety.
